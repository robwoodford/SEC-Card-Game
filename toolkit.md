# Structure of the toolkit (Petals, Tasks and Cards)
There are ten categories (we call them "Petals") within the toolkit. These are based on the ten pillars outlined in the Net Zero Action Plan (2023-2023) and are shown below.

Reducing energy use in our buildings is particularly urgent, because it's hard to know what to do and some changes are expensive.  Energy prices are rising so fast that thinking now makes good financial sense, plus there are generous government grants for the more expensive changes that won't last forever.  So for these tasks, we also have a set of **cards** you can use that will help you make the right choices.

The cards were designed by a property volunteer in one of our churches based on her experiences in about twenty churches and halls.  Her first set of cards have already been used by around 25 churches and community centres around the UK.  They tell us using them is fun and makes planning for the future much easier.

So you understand how the petals connect with tasks, and tasks connect with cards, here's a basic image to give a broad overview.
