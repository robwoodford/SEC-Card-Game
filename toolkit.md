# Structure of the toolkit (Petals, Tasks and Cards)
There are ten categories (we call them "Petals") within the toolkit. These are based on the ten pillars outlined in the Net Zero Action Plan (2023-2023) and are shown below.

Reducing energy use in our buildings is particularly urgent, because it's hard to know what to do and some changes are expensive.  Energy prices are rising so fast that thinking now makes good financial sense, plus there are generous government grants for the more expensive changes that won't last forever.  So for these tasks, we also have a set of Net Zero Cards you can use that will help you make the right choices.

So you understand how the petals connect with tasks, and tasks connect with cards, here's a basic image to give a broad overview.
