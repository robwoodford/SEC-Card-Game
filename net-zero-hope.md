Our Net Zero Action Plan lays out a positive future for the church, tackling head on the UN triple planetary crises of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss and pollution.

With unerring focus and dedicated resources, we can address these challenges, transforming the operations of the Scottish Episcopal Church to act in harmony with the living ecosystems in which it resides.

Our 2030 vision is of a flourishing future for the whole church.

| Our Net Zero 2030 vision                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| We are realising the 5th mark of mission ‘to strive to safeguard the integrity of creation and sustain and renew the life of the earth’ – embedding the principles of discipleship, justice and hope in all we do – giving voice to those on the receiving end of climate change and supporting a just transition for the people of Scotland. |
| Our churches & ancillary halls are resilient places of warm welcome at the heart of the communities they serve, with lower operational costs and powered by renewable energy. Our rectories are warmer, lowering costs for clergy & contributing to their wellbeing. |
| The land we care for is rich in biodiversity, providing places of refuge and calm for nature to thrive. |
| The products and services that we use are carefully considered, based on the principles of reject, reduce, reuse, recycle and restore. We are a zero-waste church, contributing to the circular economy. |
| We are a climate literate church, fully understanding the systemic link between climate change and biodiversity loss, acknowledging that climate change and biodiversity loss are part of a wider set of planetary boundaries which we must seek not to transgress further. |
| Our worship is rooted, rejoicing in our interdependence within the ecosystems of creation. |
| We maintain a prudent but holistic approach to finances, embedding climate justice in all the financial decisions we take. |
| We are part of a broader movement of change both nationally and internationally, resolute in our call for system change within the current cultural milieu in which we live and move and have our being. |
| We are a church that maintains a credible voice for justice in the world, being an active part of the solution in Scotland’s journey to net zero and taking a leadership role in the process. |
| We are beacons of hope in action, actively participating in the process of healing creation. |


Our intent is that with this hope-filled vision, each diocese and charge will adapt it and make it their own, contextualising it for your mission whilst transforming it into living practice. This plan is a call for the whole church to draw together in hope-filled passion, using its collective energy and determination to make a flourishing future a reality.
