A checklist for the Tasks identified in this Net Zero Toolkit is available for download.

This will allow you and your group to easily view and organise the Tasks, prioritise them and assign people to take these items forward. The  Checklist will aid your planning, enable you to track progress across meetings and provide a space for note taking.

The checklist also provides a summary of the Desired Outcomes outlined in the Net Zero Action Plan (2023-2030), helping us all to see how our actions can contribute to the objectives laid out in the provincial plan.
