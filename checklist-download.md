A checklist for the Tasks identified across the ten petals (categories) of this Net Zero Toolkit is available.

[Download the checklist .pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Bx4ZEfpsb-qC0lxoiVfmRu8eDFPneKP/view?usp=sharing).

This will allow you and your group to easily view and organise the Tasks, prioritise them and assign people to take these items forward. The  Checklist will help aid your planning, track progress across meetings and provide a space for note taking.
