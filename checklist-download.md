A [checklist](link coming) (LINK COMING} of the many tasks included in the Net Zero Toolkit is available to download and print. 

This will allow you to easily view and organise all the many tasks included in the toolkit, prioritise the actions and assign people in order to make notes between your meetings. We hope this resource supports you in planning your work accordingly.
