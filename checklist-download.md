A [checklist](link coming) (LINK COMING} of the many tasks included in the Net Zero Toolkit is available to download and print. 

This will allow you to easily view and organise all the Tasks included in this Net Zero Toolkit, prioritise them and assign people to take these items forward. This will help you track progress across meetings and provide a space for note taking.

We hope this checklist supports you in planning your work accordingly.
