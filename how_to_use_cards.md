There are two editions of the Net Zero Cards.
 -	The online edition version found here, which are embedded into the various ‘Petals’ and Tasks of this Net Zero Toolkit.
 -	A physical pack of 50+ cards which can be ordered through the General Synod Office of the Scottish Episcopal Church.

When using the physical cards, they are best explored in groups of six to eight people. We suggest you spread the cards on the table and go around the room, allowing people to choose a card in turn and placing them into three areas:

1. Actions we should definitely take
2. Actions that aren’t for us - because we’ve taken them or they don’t suit our building and how we intend to use it in future
3. Actions we are unsure about

Leave time at the end of your session together to think about what happens next. For actions you should take, who should do that, and when? For actions you are unsure about, how will you find more information so you can make a decision? Do you need more time to think about it together or to take the views of other people? You may find it helpful to have one person take notes during this part of the session. We provide a template you can use for this.

Some groups prefer to record audio snippets with what they’ve agreed about each card and have someone fill out the planning template afterwards.

The Net Zero Workshops provide a facilitated process which you support you through this process.
