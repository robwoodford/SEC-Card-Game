There are two editions of the Net Zero Cards:-
 -	The Online Cards Edition, embedded into the various ‘Petals’ and Tasks of this Net Zero Toolkit.
 -	The Physical Cards Edition, a pack of 50+ cards which can be ordered through the General Synod Office of the Scottish Episcopal Church.

At present, these Net Zero Cards focus on the priority areas identified in the [Net Zero Action Plan (2023-2030)](https://www.scotland.anglican.org/wp-content/uploads/NZAP-For-GS-2023-Final.pdf) - namely Energy Efficiency Improvements, Clean Energy and Positive Finances. Over time, we expect the cards to expand to other Petal areas.
