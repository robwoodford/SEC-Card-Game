Taking the required steps, in the right order and prioritising all the various actions is complex and no one size fits all.

With this in mind, we intend to pilot a new Net Zero workshop programme that can be organised with charges in conjunction with our partner Heathack.

These workshops will delve into the first two objectives of the Net Zero Action Plan (Energy Efficiency Improvements and Clean Energy) in order to help you save money and provide a plan of action to work towards Net Zero 2030.

In particular it will help you review:
- Actions you should definitely take
- Actions that aren't for you - because you've taken them or they don't suit your building or how you intend to use it in future
- Actions you are unsure about

The intention is to pilot this workshop programme in 2023, rolling out the programme more broadly during 2024.
