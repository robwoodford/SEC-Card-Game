Taking the required steps, in the right order and prioritising all the various actions is complex and no one size fits all.

We are piloting Net Zero Workshops from September 2023. The workshops will take around 6 hours in total and are for groups of 6-10 people from a congregation and its local community and give a clear structure for making plans that will save money, reduce energy use, and take practical steps towards net zero.

 The workshops are based on a programme from HeatHack that is already successfully helping community groups with their energy use.  The programme was written by an SEC member based on her experiences in our buildings.  If you are ready to sign up now, you can join their programme and take advantage of their Royal Academy of Engineering funding to get a free temperature and relative humidity monitor and minor expenses paid.  Just make sure HeatHack knows you are from the SEC.
