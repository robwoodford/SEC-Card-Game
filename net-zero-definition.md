Carbon emissions associated with reaching net zero are generally categorised into three types of emissions known as ‘scopes’. 
* Scope 1 emissions are the direct emissions arising from on-site generation of energy in our buildings, vehicles, or land. 
* Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions associated with the use of electricity, heat, steam, and/or cooling.
* Scope 3 emissions are all other indirect emissions that occur in the day to day running of the church’s operations – in other words the purchased goods and services the church uses, its waste, water use as well as reimbursable work-related travel.

For the SEC Net Zero 2023-2030 action plan, we are including all Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as reimbursable travel from scope 3. This is summarised in the graphic above with the dotted lines representing those emissions that should be addressed by 2030.

You can find a full overview of the scopes of inclusion and the rationale behind this in the [Net Zero Action Plan (2023-2030)](https://www.scotland.anglican.org/wp-content/uploads/NZAP-For-GS-2023-Final.pdf).
