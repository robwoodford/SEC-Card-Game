Each of our Net Zero Cards describes an action your congregation could take and is marked with a number of features to help guide you through the game.  

The front of the card has the action title with a unique icon for that card, and also shows the "petal" category for the card as given in the Net Zero Toolkit.  There's a good order for considering the cards that relate to buildings, so for these we also have a step number at the bottom, from 1 to 6.

The back of the card adds a 100 word summary of the card action with a brief motivating quote, and then shows two further things:  the relative cost and the potential carbon savings.

**Costs** are on a scale of 1 to 5.  Our buildings vary so much in size that they don't correspond to actual price tags!  Here is what they are intended to mean:

1. actions the group might decide to just go ahead and do immediately
2. actions that might only take delegated decisions to a property management committee
3. in-between actions
4. actions where groups are likely to have to raise funds via the community or grants
5. actions likely to require substantial grant fund-raising and planning, including evidence of community engagement events and donations from the congregation or local community

**Carbon savings** are on a scale from \*, bringing modest improvements, to \*\*\*\*\*, with very large carbon savings.

The levels can only be very rough because your costs and benefits will depend on your building and how you use it, but we hope they form a useful guide.
