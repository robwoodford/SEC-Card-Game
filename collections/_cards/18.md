<p>On a combi-boiler, “hot water preheat” keeps a bit of water hot at all times. It makes the water in your tap run hot faster.  If you’re lucky, there’s an “Eco” button on your boiler to turn it off.  If your building users then complain, an electrician could link it to the heating timings.  If you have high hot water demand, you might also benefit from a CombiSave to restrict water flow until it’s hot.</p><p>Usually hot water delay is because of the distance between boiler and tap.  If it’s a problem, consider electric point-of-use hot water heaters. </p>
