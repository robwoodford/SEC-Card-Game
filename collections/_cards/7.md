<p>Many community buildings have thermostats or temperature sensors that don’t work because they are on a very cold wall or in a corner without good airflow.  It’s also common to find wired ones that are no longer wired in and wireless ones with flat batteries.  If your space ever overheats, you’ll want to check this.  A flat battery can also cause some systems to come on permanently or using a default heating schedule.</p>
