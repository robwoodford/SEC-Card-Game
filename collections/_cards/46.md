<p>To reduce emissions associated with Scope 2 emissions, PEG recommend charges move to a verified 100% renewable electricity tariff. Many tariffs that claim 100% renewable are susceptible to greenwashing. To help charges select tariffs that are credible, PEG intend to use criteria adopted by the Church Advisors Energy Network which go beyond simple reliance on trading Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGO). This criteria reviews whether a company’s tariffs are all renewable, whether they rely on offsetting, whether units sold are the same as those supported by REGO’s, whether the company has its own generation and whether purchase from other generators is direct.</p>
