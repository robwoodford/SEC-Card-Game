<p>Most buildings have lots of ways to control the ventilation and assume people will be sensible, for instance, closing vents while a space warms up and opening them to release moist air when people leave.  Help your users know what to do.  You may want to add features like window trickle vents to make things easier, or consider our extractor fan card.  </p><p> If you don’t know how much ventilation you need a relative humidity sensor will tell you.  The Health and Safety Executive has guidance about using a CO2 monitor for health safety checks.</p>
