<p>Draughts let cold air in and make people uncomfortable.  Consider windows including cracked glass, doors, loft hatches, holes from previous extractor fans, and gaps around pipework, in floorboards, and under skirting boards. Professionals have access to better materials and skills than you do. Draughtproofing windows is expensive but can make all the difference.</p><p>Blocking up original ventilation features could make your building damp - if you think they let in too much air, take professional advice. In rectories, chimneys can have their airflow reduced with a chimney balloon, chimney cap, or a board covering the hearth, but they do need some airflow.</p>
