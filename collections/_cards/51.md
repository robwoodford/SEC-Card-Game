<p>A small, discreet "data logger" will take temperature and relative humidity readings at regular intervals and save them for you to pick up or send them to an internet service. Their data plots will show trends and patterns that will help you get the heat to the right places at the right times and get better professional energy efficiency advice.  Churches often use them to monitor damp or to discover that a small expenditure on the right controls saves them a lot of gas. </p><p>If you have fancy heating controls, they might already log temperature for you.</p>
