<p>Users don’t understand how boilers work, but if they aren’t happy, they’ll turn dials and press buttons.  It’s especially important for them not to re-pressurise boilers themselves, even though they may think they know how to do this from home. If they do it while the system is running, that could damage it. </p><p>If your boiler is in a public space, you may need to be creative about how to use joinery or paper blu tacked over the controls to give the message that they are not for use.</p>
