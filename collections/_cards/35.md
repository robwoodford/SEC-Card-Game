<p>In an uninsulated building, the roof is usually the first insulation action to take. You could create a “cold roof” by laying insulation above the ceiling of the top floor, leaving the loft space cold and well-ventilated, or a “warm roof” by placing rigid boards between and over the roof rafters. As always, in traditional buildings breathability matters.  Cold roof designs save more energy because they are more effective and reduce the heated space.  If your roof can’t be insulated, you may be able to install a false ceiling and insulate above that.</p>
