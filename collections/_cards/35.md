<p>The heat lost through floors is usually less than through other surfaces, but because people touch the floor, it has a big effect on their comfort. Even carpets help some.  For suspended timber floors, breathability matters.  Consider hemp batting hung in nets under the joists or breathable boards lain on runners attached to the joists.  Some floorboards might have to come up temporarily to add them.  </p><p>Solid floors generally lose less heat than suspended ones. Concrete and other floors that can’t be lifted are either insulated over the top, creating a step up, or when the floor needs replaced. </p>
