<p>The best way to be sure you aren’t using any gas or electricity for heating is to turn the heating completely off, especially if your users can bring the heating on. Radiators are a popular way of warming croissants in all seasons.   Even if your users don’t bring on the heating, your system might. For instance, if you keep your usual heating diary set and just rely on the thermostat to keep the heating off, your system is probably firing up the boilers just in case.</p>
