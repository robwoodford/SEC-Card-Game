<p>Electric heating, urns and sound equipment often get left on, even overnight. You can buy special “countdown timers" or  “time delay push” switches that will only supply electricity to a device for a set amount of time before the user will need to use the switch again.   There are also timers available, although they're only useful if the electrics should be on for a very regular schedule.   Alternatively, you could put in hotel-style keycards that control whether electricity is supplied to some circuits.</p>
