<p>You should only be considering carbon offsetting if you have exhausted or achieved all other possibilities for absolute emissions reduction. For an offsetting scheme to be genuine, it must demonstrate long term permanent storage of carbon with a low risk of reversal. Many offsetting schemes perpetrate other injustices such as displacing communities, double counting, or even destroying natural carbon sinks.  Furthermore, global land use demand for forestry offset plans is currently around 1.2 billion hectares (roughly the same land mass as the USA and Mexico combined). The world simply doesn’t have a spare continent available for offsetting.</p>
