<p>If you can’t address heat loss, it doesn’t make sense to try to heat the air in the space and keep it in the building.  Instead, you could install radiant heaters that act like mini suns for use just when people are in, providing heat directly to the people.  There are charges that use them successfully as the sole heating solution across churches, halls, and offices. The system must be carefully designed with the right wave length for the space, and it works better if the furniture doesn’t block the heat. Not all of them glow and it's possible to get chandeliers.</p>
