<p>Some churches have already decided that the best-dressed worshippers are wearing blankets. Others are rethinking the convention that only women and bishops wear hats indoors and wondering how the congregation would feel about processional hymns.  One church is wondering whether they can enable congregations to worship in their halls December to February - it’s more intimate and suits some people better.  If nothing else, perhaps this card will lead to some interesting conversations about how we worship, where we worship and why.</p>
