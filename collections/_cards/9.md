<p>If a radiator is too cold to the touch and not heating a room enough, you or your installer may have turned up the boiler thermostat or increased the pump speed to compensate - or your users might find their own energy-wasting ways to cope.  It’s better to find out why the radiator is cold in the first place.  A broken Thermostatic Radiator Valve (TRV), stuck valve, air or sludge in the radiator, a faulty pump, or an unbalanced system can all cause this problem.</p>
