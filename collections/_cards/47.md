<p>Photovoltaic (PV) solar panels generate electricity for immediate use, battery storage, or sale to the grid.  For most community buildings they make more sense than using panels to heat water.  If your roof is weak, high up, has lots of obstacles, or is the wrong orientation or wrong slope, maybe you have enough space for ground mounted panels.  On a roof, think about the impact on rainwater clearance.  Solar slates are coming but are expensive and still have teething problems.  </p><p>You should consider planning permission requirements in your area. If finance is an issue, solar cooperatives might be willing to take your site on. </p>
