<p>Thermal curtains and blinds cut draughts and block cold surfaces from making people uncomfortable.  The cheapest option is tightly woven or foam-backed lined curtains that fit well.  More expensive options perform better because they use fancier materials or trap air movement by adding a box at the top (a 'pelmet') or are blinds that attach to the window frame.  Some home sewers can make cheap but effective curtains and blinds.  </p><p> You can put a curtain on a fire exit to help during a building’s warm-up, but it must be left open when people are in. </p>
