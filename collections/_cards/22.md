<p>Sometimes a building will have several halls, all of them lightly used, and just moving people so they are in the same or adjacent spaces will save on heating. If using a heat the people approach, such as pew heaters (see 'Install heated seating' card), only heat the seats you anticipate will be used. People are unlikely to sit where it's cold so they will be drawn to sit where the heaters are on and you can use this technique to cluster users and reduce the need to heat areas that aren’t being used.  </p>
