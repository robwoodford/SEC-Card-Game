<p>Planning for change means you won't get caught out when equipment fails.  For electrics, you want new equipment to be as efficient as possible.  Heating takes special care because you want to do things in the right order.  For instance, it’s best to put in underfloor heating when the flooring is being changed, not afterwards.  Good planning requires  maintenance records so you can spot recurring problems and save you scrapping a whole system when one part fails. </p><p>If you still have a non-condensing boiler, you should make planning your next heating system a top priority.</p>
