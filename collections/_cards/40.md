<p>Secondary glazing can be a very good option in some buildings, especially if changes to the original single glazing are not allowed. It has the advantage of improving the window draughtproofing - in some installations ventilation in winter can be supplied just by opening the secondary glazing a crack. It’s generally cheaper than double glazing but perhaps half as effective. A lot depends on how well the windows fit and the distance between the panes. 12mm is the ideal for heat loss, although a bigger distance is better for noise reduction. </p>
