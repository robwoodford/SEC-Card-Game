<p>Lights in community buildings are frequently left on by accident. If the light switch also controls an extractor fan, this can waste a lot of heating. </p><p>Some lights and fans have motion sensing built in. For others, you can have an electrician add a separate motion sensor.  They can sense movement up to 30 feet away, so can be used in relatively large rooms and don’t take much power to run.</p>
