<p>Fan convectors are often set to dump heat too fast, making people uncomfortable because the heating bangs on and off.  They usually have controls that let you set the fan speed and slow it down when the space is approaching the right temperature, which is a form of “load compensation” to keep it from overshooting. You should consider consulting with an engineer on whether the current settings are right for you. To find the controls, they may need to take the cover off.  Whilst they are reviewing the settings, consider cleaning the filter! </p>
