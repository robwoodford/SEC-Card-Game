<p>If building users don’t feel comfortable, they may take matters into their own hands and change timed controls, turn up radiators or bring their own plug-in heating. If this is happening frequently, look at how adjustments can be made to reduce the need for users to seek their own solutions. Consider reduced range thermostats or limiting pins or covers. If you have a thermostat in one room that turns off heating in rooms with other groups, smart Thermostatic Radiator Valves might help. </p><p>If your main heating system is very slow, you probably shouldn’t let users turn it on at all. </p>
