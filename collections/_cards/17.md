<p>Condensing boilers can’t recover wasted heat unless the flow temperature is around 70C or below. The lower the flow temperature, down to 45C, the better the heat recovery works and sometimes the gentler heat is more comfortable.  Lowering the flow temperature is more likely to work for buildings with generously sized radiators, low heat loss, and longer heating periods.  The lower the setting, the earlier you have to turn on the heating, so you’ll need to experiment to find the most efficient setting.  </p><p>  Non-condensing boilers and ones that feed hot water tanks should be run at 70C or above. </p>
