<p>Most systems don’t have modern energy efficiency controls, but they can be cheap enough they’re even used in houses.  If you are heating the building based on an event schedule, you probably want “optimised start control”.  This learns when to turn the heating on depending on the weather. If you heat for longer periods or most of the day, “weather compensation” is more appropriate so the system runs cooler when it’s warm out.  If your spaces warm quickly, you might benefit from “load compensation”, which slows the heating down as it reaches temperature so it won’t overshoot.</p>
