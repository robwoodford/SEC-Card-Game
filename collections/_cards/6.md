<p>Twice hourly smart meter readings will help the UK reduce the number of power stations we need. Smart meters have a display you can put elsewhere to show how much energy you use. If the supplier won’t give you all the data, you can get it using a third party app. The full data will allow you and your professionals to spot waste and estimate the cost of energy for room hires. </p><p> Installers can test the meter will be able to connect to the network before installation. The meters have improved greatly in the last few years.</p>
