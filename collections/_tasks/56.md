Engage with other churches, ecumenical partners, interfaith groups, and local community groups on climate issues; explore how you might work together, share skills and encourage one another. Engage with youth groups and community groups (e.g. local parks, offering things in the local parks for others rather than just in our churches). Church In Society will provide support to enable engagement with schools and care homes on these issues.
