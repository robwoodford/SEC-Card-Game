Review all of the consumables used in worship (See also Zero Waste). Specially, reduce or eliminate single-use plastic containers and minimize other forms of packaging; reduce the combustion of fossil fuels in candles and thuribles; use printed liturgy and hymn books or projected texts rather than single-use printed orders of service (except on special occasions where they might be considered as souvenirs of the occasion); use locally produced and seasonal floral materials rather than imported blooms; in floral arrangements find alternatives to ‘Oasis’ which do not leave a lasting residue of microplastics in the environment.
