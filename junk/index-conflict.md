# Welcome to the Net Zero Toolkit
Thank you for your interest in our Net Zero Toolkit and the associated Net Zero Cards.

These resources have been designed to complement the Scottish Episcopal Church [Net Zero Action Plan (2023-2030)](https://www.scotland.anglican.org/wp-content/uploads/NZAP-For-GS-2023-Final.pdf) released in June 2023.

This updated version of the toolkit aims to:
-  Provide an overview of Net Zero, how we define this and the values that we have used to guide the church's approach
-  Help churches identify specific actions that they can take to work towards Net Zero 2030
-  Demonstrate where help and support are available, including third party tools and resources
-  Provide a simple guide to the process - recognising that no one size fits all

## Getting started
With so much work to do, it can be hard to know where to start. The petals below break down the necessary actions into manageable steps which can be built upon progressively and realistically. There are many small tasks that can be easily accomplished - indeed, many churches will find that they are doing them already. It is intended primarily for congregations, but dioceses, provincial bodies and individuals may also find the checklist helpful.

Jump to the Toolkit Structure menu item (on the left side panel) if you're eager to start some action!


<!-- 
## Future iterations
This toolkit will be updated on an iterative basis, sharing additional resources and creating further tools to help support you as and when we get them. We hope that you will share your good practice and collaborative working locally, and within your Diocese, so that a whole network of support builds.
