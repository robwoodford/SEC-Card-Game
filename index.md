# Welcome to the Net Zero Toolkit
Thank you for your interest in our Net Zero Toolkit and the associated Net Zero Cards.

These resources have been designed to complement the Scottish Episcopal Church [Net Zero Action Plan (2023-2030)](https://www.scotland.anglican.org/wp-content/uploads/NZAP-For-GS-2023-Final.pdf) released in June 2023.

This updated version of the toolkit aims to:
-  Provide an overview of Net Zero, how the Scottish Episcopal Church has defined this, and the values that have guided the approach.
-  Help churches identify specific tasks that they can take in order to work towards Net Zero 2030.
-  Demonstrate where help and support are available, including third party tools and resources.
-  Provide a simple guide to the process - recognising that no one size fits all.

## Getting started
With so much work to do, it can be hard to know where to start. The ten core objectives of the Net Zero Action Plan (or petals as we call them) are broken down into a number of tasks and set of steps, which can be built upon progressively and realistically. There are a number of basic tasks that can be easily accomplished by all - indeed many churches will find that they are doing these.

This toolkit is intended primarily for congregations but dioceses, provincial bodies and individuals may also find it helpful.

## Future iterations
This toolkit will be updated on an iterative basis, sharing additional resources and creating further tools to help support you as and when we get them. We hope that you will share your good practice and collaborative working locally, and within your Diocese, so that a whole network of support builds.

Please provide feedback on ways to improve this at [environment@scotland.anglican.org](mailto:environment@scotland.anglican.org)

NOTE: This toolkit is still in the early stages of development,
but it gives you a sense of what it will contain and the direction we are heading.
